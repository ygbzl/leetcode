 * Created by zhupd on 2/22/2017.
 *
 * You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

 For example, given:
 s: "barfoothefoobarman"
 words: ["foo", "bar"]

 You should return the indices: [0,9].
